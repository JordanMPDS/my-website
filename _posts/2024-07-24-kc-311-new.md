KC 311 is a hotline for Kansas City residents to report a problem, request a service, or ask a question about a city service.  KC moved to a new CRM tool which allowed the public to access the data via an API through Socrata.

This new dashboard also has a completly redesigned backend utilizing a modern data warehouse on Azure. Below is a sample of the structure of ingesting and preparing the data on Databricks, storing the data in a data lake, and serving the data via SQL Warehouse and Power BI.

Below is the new dashboard powered by a serverless SQL warehouse.  If the resource is not running it will take approximately 30 seconds to spinup. Various other changes have taken place to the report itself such as formatting, more visuals, and more filtering criteria in the Slicer Pane.

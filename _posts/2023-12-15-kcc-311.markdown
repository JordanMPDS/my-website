Background

KC 311 is a hotline for Kansas City residents to report a problem, request a service, or ask a question about a city service.  I found this data set from data.world when searching for publicly available data.  I learned a lot about setting up ArcGIS for public consumption because it requires specific criteria in order to work properly.

This dashboard is fully interactive and allows users to see the details of the various cases through different filters and selections.  There is also a separate page for seeing case details so as to not clutter up the page with visualizations.

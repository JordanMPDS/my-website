**This is the old dashboard. Please refer to the [new dashboard]({% post_url 2024-07-24-kc-311-new %}) to see the updated version.**

KC 311 is a hotline for Kansas City residents to report a problem, request a service, or ask a question about a city service.  I found this data set from data.world when searching for publicly available data.

A new visual in this dashboard is the ArcGIS map.  This requires an ArcGIS license, but enables much more powerful mapping than is available in other map visuals in Power BI.  There are also many settings that need to be configured to allow ArcGIS available for public consumption.

This dashboard is fully interactive and allows users to see the details of the various cases through different filters and selections.  There is also a separate page for seeing case details so as to not clutter up the page with visualizations.
